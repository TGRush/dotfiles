# This is my Dotfiles, and stuff
### uh yeah, I got no idea if I'm doing this right...

## My Sway configuration (`~/.config/sway/config`)
#### This is mostly the default config, other than:
- loading `Waybar` instead of the default Sway bar
- Executing `nm-applet`
- (attempting to) remove VSCodium window borders lol
- PyWal stuff
- binding grimshot to print and print+ctrl

## My Waybar configuration and Style.css (`~/.config/waybar/config` and `~/.config/waybar/style.css`)
#### Changes to config:
- remove like 90% of the things on the panel because it was just ***A LOT***
#### Changes to style.css
- I don't even remember if I did any changes to this, but I'll include it *just in case*

## Packages
I don't remember everything I installed, though I'll try my best to list everything:
- `grimshot` (AUR)
- `ttf-fira-code`
- `waybar`
- `xdg-desktop-portal-wlr` (portals screensharing over Pipewire, make sure this is setup first)
- `gnome-keyring` (so that vscodium doesn't die of not having a keyring on Sway)
